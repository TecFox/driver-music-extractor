# Driver Music Extractor #
A tool which extracts/converts the music files from the MUSIC.BIN archive used in Driver 1 (PSX) &amp; Driver 2

## Download ##
The program can be downloaded from [here](https://www.binary-fennec.de/downloads/driver-music-extractor.zip).

## Usage / Info ##
The tool expects a single argument in the form of a filename. Run it via the command line or just drag &amp; drop the MUSIC.BIN file from one of the games onto the exe. The program will then convert and extract the modules to a folder named MUSIC.

Please note: Don't run this program with any file other than MUSIC.BIN. It WILL crash.
Since this file has no header it's impossible to identify it so the program will blindly assume that you're giving it the correct one.
